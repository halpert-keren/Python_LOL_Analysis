# Python League Of Legends Analysis

The report (the PDF file) presents that a strong relationship exists between a few of the criteria of the
League of Legends game achievements and the determination of the winning team.
I have found throughout this project that the team in the game that has attained three
specific successes has an extremely high chance of winning the game.
The three feats any team should strive for in the LoL game are:
  1. Be the first team to destroy an enemy turret
  2. Be the first team to kill an enemy baron
  3. Be the team to kill more jungle minions than the enemy
A team that has accomplished all three is almost guaranteed to be the victor.
